# Interview Follow Up

Good afternoon all,

I hope this email finds you well! Thank you both for sitting down with me and explaining the details of the role and your willingness to work with me in acquiring the skills you are searching for. I have begun a self study of Microsoft SQL via SkillSets which has been generously made available through our department.

Thanks for reaching out and for extending this opportunity. I look forward to any update on further steps in the interview process. I appreciate both of you for giving me the opportunity to possibly advance my career with this role. In the meantime, I hope you have a great week!

Best,

Kellen
